# pr2_pbd
Using [Maya Cakmak's PbD system](https://github.com/PR2/pr2_pbd) as a base, my fork contains branches for different projects, as well as branches for different aspects within each project.

This means there are lots of branches, and it can be hard to tell what is what.

Git's branching system doesn't support branch descriptions, and branch names need to be concise, so the this `README.md` file in the root of the repository will contain information about the branch it's in.

## branch: priya
### Purpose
Code to run a demo of Mike's ICRA 2014 paper on the PR2 (instead of Gambit).

### Description
This runs a loop where the robot asks for colored blocks in an 8 x 8 grid and sets them down on a plane in front of it. It is based off of [Priya Rao's code](https://github.com/priyarao27/pr2_pbd/) (she did the majority of the work). Implementation notes are [here](https://github.com/mbforbes/pr2_pbd/wiki/Press-Release:-Plans).
