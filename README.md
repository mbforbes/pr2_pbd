# pr2_pbd
Using [Maya Cakmak's PbD system](https://github.com/PR2/pr2_pbd) as a base, my fork contains branches for different projects, as well as branches for different aspects within each project.

This means there are lots of branches, and it can be hard to tell what is what.

Git's branching system doesn't support branch descriptions, and branch names need to be concise, so the this `README.md` file in the root of the repository will contain information about the branch it's in.

## branch: test-grasping
### Purpose
This branch is for trying out the automatic grasping capabilities built into the PR2 Object Manipulation stack (pr2_interactive_manipulation).

### Description
I'm testing out the built-in functionality by trying to run demos and then using API calls.
