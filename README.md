# pr2_pbd
Using [Maya Cakmak's PbD system](https://github.com/PR2/pr2_pbd) as a base, my fork contains branches for different projects, as well as branches for different aspects within each project.

This means there are lots of branches, and it can be hard to tell what is what.

Git's branching system doesn't support branch descriptions, and branch names need to be concise, so the this `README.md` file in the root of the repository will contain information about the branch it's in.

## branch: success-testing

### Purpose
Test user-provided fixes on real test data on the real robot (desktop version, with GUI) on this branch.

### Description
This branch contains the score functions as well as a full GUI for loading up test scenarios, automatically scoring them based on different score functions, and loading the action. It is the desktop component of the success testing.

As a prerequisite, you must have done reachability testing (all worker actions vs all test scenarios). This is because doing so is expensive (dozens of hours) and so should be done offline and beforehand. Because of this requirement, we can quickly filter out unreachable demonstrations and score only the reachable ones. (This data is a log file, generated by branch `da`).
