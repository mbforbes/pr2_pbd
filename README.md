# pr2_pbd
Using [Maya Cakmak's PbD system](https://github.com/PR2/pr2_pbd) as a base, my fork contains branches for different projects, as well as branches for different aspects within each project.

This means there are lots of branches, and it can be hard to tell what is what.

Git's branching system doesn't support branch descriptions, and branch names need to be concise, so the this `README.md` file in the root of the repository will contain information about the branch it's in.

## branch: mock-objects

### Purpose
Run user studies with this branch.

### Description
This is the branch on which the Crowd PbD project is based. It serves as the "main branch" off of which most other code is branched. User studies may be run using this branch.
