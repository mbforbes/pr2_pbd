# TODO
0. multi-object comparison (e.g. for size)
0. pick-up w/ `pr2_object_manipulation`
0. all movement w/ `pr2_object_manipulation` for collision avoidance
0. rest of actions (shouldn't be too hard)
0. implement phrases (in parser) and push them through the pipeline here
0. referring expressions test (will the above do it? or need addl. channel?)
