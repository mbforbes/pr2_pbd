# TODO
0. multi-object comparison (e.g. for size)
0. implement phrases (in parser) and push them through the pipeline here
0. rest of actions (shouldn't be too hard)
0. have parser generate most likely phrases for each object
0. referring expressions test (will the above do it? or need addl. channel?)
0. all movement w/ `pr2_object_manipulation` for collision avoidance
